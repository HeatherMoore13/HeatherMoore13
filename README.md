I did not have a chance to finish any project.
I understand classes but I am having issues with incooperating them. 
All of my code needs to be enhanced. I need to get a better understanding of C+.
Incooperating the code with multiple files was a challange and still is.
Classes, reading and writing files will be transferrable to ther projects.
I need work with making programs readable, adaptable and maintainable.
